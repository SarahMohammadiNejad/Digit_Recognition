# Digit_Recognition

In this project we implement a Convolutional Neural Network model to predict the digit that is written in an image. We have a folder of digit images (200 immage per digit). The model is trained based of 80% of these images. Then we apply the trained model on the test part of data and the accuracy of the model is about score = 0.938.
